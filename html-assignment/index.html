        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Natália, and I am from a city in southern Brazil called Maringá. From 2014 to 2018, I studied Law and worked in this field until a short time before arriving in Canada on April 5<sup>th</sup>, 2024. As I never really felt a strong connection to that field, I had been thinking about changing careers for the past few years, and web design has always interested me. Also, my husband is a web developer, and seeing him work in the field also inspired me to make a career change. Moreover, both my husband and I have always wanted to experience living abroad, especially to improve our English and to get to know different cultures. These are the main reasons why I decided to pursue <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr>.</p>
        <p>As you mentioned you like animals, I would like to take this opportunity to let you know that in future assignments, I might introduce you to some of my pets who are staying with my parents in Brazil: three cats named <em>Nino, Toddy</em>, and <em>Fred</em>, and two dogs named <em>Loba</em> and <em>Petit</em>.</p>
